![output](https://github.com/OscarCreator/rsync.nvim/assets/53407525/c5c402bd-98ac-4899-9ce0-ebf27db28d29)

## Dependencies

- [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- rsync

## Installation

```lua
use {
    'OscarCreator/rsync.nvim',
    run = 'make',
    requires = {'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'},
    config = function()
        require("rsync").setup()
    end
}
```

## Usage

**rsync.nvim** looks for `.nvim/rsync.toml` file by default in the root of
your project. The path can also be set with the `project_config_path`
key in the plugin configuration.

The current options available:

```toml
# this is the path to the remote. Can be either a local/remote filepath.
remote_path = "../copy/"
# or if using ssh
remote_path = "user@host:/home/user/path/"

# specifying a file(s) which should be synced "down" but are on .gitignore.
# this is a workaround to sync down files which are included on .gitignore
remote_includes = "build.log"
# or using an array if multiple files are needed.
remote_includes = ["build.log", "build/generated.json"]
```
