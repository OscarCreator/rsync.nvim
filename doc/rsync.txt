1. Introduction                                             *rsync.nvim*

This plugin leverages the power of rsync to sync your entire project
on save. So if you have a remote evironment but want to use you local
tools to edit files then this is the perfect plugin for you!

                                                          *rsync-config*
|rsync.nvim| looks for `.nvim/rsync.toml` file in the root of your project.
The configuration options valid are:

- remote_path
    Local/remote filepath.

- remote_includes
    Filepaths to files part of .gitignore but wanted to be included when
    syncing down with |:RsyncDown|.

3. Functions                                            *rsync-function*


                                                        *rsync.config()*
rsync.config()
    If current project have a |rsync-config| file, then the config is retured
    as a lua table. Otherwise this will return nil.

                                                        *rsync.status()*
rsync.status()
    Returns the sync status. This can be useful to use inside a statusline.
    As this is the main usage for this function, |rsync.nvim| caches the
    |rsync-config| of the project to make this function faster.
